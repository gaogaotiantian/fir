This is a AI for "五子棋". To write an AI, you need to do the following:

1. Create a file ai*.cpp based on your id. You can use ai1.cpp as an example. 
The function name has to be unique but you can name your AI anything you like.
The prototype has to be exactly the same as exampleAI.

2. Edit makefile, add ai*.cpp in FILES.

3. Edit AI_Name.h:
    -- change MAX_AI_NUM
    -- declare your AI function
    -- add the name in AIList

4. type make in the folder

5. run "./game.out * *", in which * represents the ID for the function.

Example: your ID is 3 and you want to compete with exampleAI, then you should
use "./game.out 1 3". The order of arguments will not affect the result because
who move first is random.

Current ID assigning:
example:1
gaogaotiantian:2
Beokro:3
jimzhu1993:4
dummyindex:5
ShaoyiZhang:6
SeraphRoy:7

Have Fun!
